This is a simple calculator program in Python that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division—between two numbers.
The program prompts the user to choose an operation, takes two numbers as input, performs the selected operation, and then prints the result. If the user selects division.
It also checks to avoid division by zero.

Main Menu:

Print a menu of available operations that the user can select from:

1 for addition

2 for subtraction

3 for multiplication

4 for division

chooseoption = int(input("Choose An Option Provided Above: "))

The program waits for the user to input a number corresponding to the chosen operation.

int(input(...)) ensures the input is converted to an integer since menu options are numbered.

result = 0

A variable result is initialized to hold the outcome of the arithmetic operation. This will be updated later based on the user's choice.

Operation Selection:

if chooseoption in (1, 2, 3, 4):

This conditional checks whether the user has chosen a valid option (1 to 4).
If a valid option is selected, the program proceeds; otherwise, it will display an invalid choice message.
Taking Input for Numbers:

number1 = float(input("Enter The First Number: "))

number2 = float(input("Enter The Second Number: "))

If a valid option is selected, the program prompts the user to input two numbers for the calculation.
float(input(...)) converts the input values to floating-point numbers, allowing the calculator to handle decimal values.

Performing the Chosen Operation:

if chooseoption == 1:

    result = number1 + number2
    
elif chooseoption == 2:

    result = number1 - number2
    
elif chooseoption == 3:

    result = number1 * number2
    
Based on the user's selection, the appropriate arithmetic operation is carried out.
If the user selects 1, the program adds number1 and number2.
If the user selects 2, the program subtracts number2 from number1.
If the user selects 3, the program multiplies the two numbers.

Handling Division:

elif chooseoption == 4:

    if number2 != 0:
    
        result = number1 / number2  # Use single slash for floating-point division
        
    else:
    
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        
        result = None
        
If the user selects 4 (division), an additional check is made to ensure that number2 is not zero.
If number2 is not zero, division proceeds.
If number2 is zero, the program prints an error message and assigns None to result to indicate that no valid result could be calculated.

Handling Invalid Option:

else:

    print("Invalid Option Chosen")
    
If the user inputs an invalid option (anything other than 1, 2, 3, or 4), the program will notify them that their choice is not valid.

Displaying the Result:

if result is not None:

    print("The Result of the Operation is: {}".format(result))
    
After performing the calculation, the program checks if result is not None (which happens if division by zero is avoided).
If a valid result exists, the result is printed in a formatted string.

Example Usage:

The program displays the options:

1. Addition: 
2. Subtraction: 
3. Multiplication: 
4. Division:
   
User selects, for instance, "2" (Subtraction).
The program asks for two numbers:

Enter The First Number: 10
Enter The Second Number: 4
The result is displayed:

The Result of the Operation is: 6.0
